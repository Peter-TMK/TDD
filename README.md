# TDD - Test-Driven Development with JEST/SUPERTEST

The are different types of Testing:

Unit Testing - Involves individual testing of functions that collectively make up our code base or business logic
Integration Testing - Involves the testing of software modules/functions that are integrated, as a group.
End-To-End Testing -  Involves the automated testing of the entire software or completed major parts of the software, with the use of some libraries such as PupeteerJS with jest.

Jest is a library used to automate test in your code in order to make the code less prone to error
